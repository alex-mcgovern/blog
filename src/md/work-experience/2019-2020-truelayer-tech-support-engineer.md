My first tech role was at TrueLayer, a fintech startup in London, focused then
on Open Banking and transitioning into a much more payments focused business. 

I was hired as a level 3 tech support engineer, responsible for triage of
escalated bug reports, filing bug reports, and writing bug fixes.

Part of my time was spent on developing our customer support portal, which is
where I began to develop an interest in web development.
