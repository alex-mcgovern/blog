[Stacklok](https://stacklok.com/) is an open-source software supply chain security company. My role focuses on the frontend for
[Trusty](https://www.trustypkg.dev) — a package intelligence tool.

So far — in addition to building out several key features — I've completely
re-written the frontend, addressed a complete lack of tests and bootstrapped a
shared component library, formalizing our design system in code.
