I had a brief stint at TrueLayer where I pulled double duty as a line manager while still doing a lot of
individual contribution. The engineering growth framework at the time
necessitated that I take on the job title of Engineering Manager.

I led a small team, still focused on our marketing website â€” a junior
developer and product manager, and a dotted line to a UX/UI designer.

I enjoyed the experience, but looking back, I realize my strengths are in
delivery and execution, rather than management.
