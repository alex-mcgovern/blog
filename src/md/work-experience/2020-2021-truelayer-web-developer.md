At TrueLayer, I was the sole developer on the marketing team, responsible for
maintaining and expanding the TrueLayer.com website. Over the course of three
years, the site grew from from 8 to nearly 400 pages. We also went through 2
rebrands during this time.

This role is where I built out my first component library. Which was
multi-theme, and proprietary to the marketing website. I learned a lot about
design systems in this time, and it was the foundation for a lot of my later
work on design systems, notably on [boondoggle.design](https://boondoggle.design).
