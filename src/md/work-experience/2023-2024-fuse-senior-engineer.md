[Fuse](https://fuse.me) is a banking-as-a-service and payments provider. My role
was lead developer on their online banking portal working with another junior
React developer.

We built and operationalized the portal in ~6 months. This included complex
features like payment initiation, foreign exchange and back-office tools like
user management and API credentials management.

Fuse very generously allowed me to use an open-source component library I
maintain, [boondoggle.design](https://boondoggle.design), as the basis for the
portal's design system. This was a great opportunity to dogfood the library and
drive it forward with real-world use cases.
