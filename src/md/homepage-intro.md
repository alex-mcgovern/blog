I like to build user experiences.

I've built complex financial applications from scratch, glossy
marketing websites and helped early stage startups look more polished on the
world stage. I've built 3 different design systems for 3 different companies —
each one with entirely different outcomes.

I love making complex systems easy to use — without hiding or limiting
capabilities — and enabling users to get more done, faster
